## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap 5
- javascript
### What I learned
I learnt majorly on how to use bootstap grid and how to use some javascript features


Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.


### Continued development
In the future, when i am done with javascript, i'll love to add some new developed  features into this same project
### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://w3schools.com) - This helped in mastering my bootstrap skills. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
